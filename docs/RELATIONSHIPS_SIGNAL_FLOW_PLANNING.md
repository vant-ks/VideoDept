## 🏗️ ARCHITECTURE CLARIFICATION

### BaseEntity Pattern (TypeScript Only - NOT Database Inheritance)

**Important:** We are **NOT** using class/subclass database inheritance. Instead:
- `BaseEntity` = TypeScript interface for code consistency
- Each entity type = Separate Prisma table (Single Table Per Entity pattern)
- No polymorphic base table, no table inheritance

**Entity Hierarchy (Conceptual):**
```
BaseEntity (TypeScript interface)
  |
  ├── Sources (Production category)
  │     ├── Computer (equipment: laptop, desktop — selected from equipment library by category)
  │     ├── Media Server (equipment: PC-based media server — computer type chosen from equipment library)
  │     ├── Camera (equipment: camera bodies)
  │     └── CCU (equipment: camera control units)
  |
  ├── Sends (Destination category)
  │     ├── Monitor (equipment: displays)
  │     ├── Recorder (equipment: recording devices)
  │     ├── Projector (equipment: projectors)
  │     └── LED Tile (equipment: LED walls)
  |
  └── Signal Flow (Routing category)
        ├── Switcher (equipment: vision switchers)
        ├── Router (equipment: routers/matrices)
        ├── LED Processor (equipment: LED processors)
        ├── Converter (equipment: signal converters)
        └── Camera Switcher (equipment: camera feed switchers)
```

**Database Reality:**
- Each category = Separate table: `computers`, `media_servers`, `cameras`, `ccus`, `sends`, etc.
- `sources` and `signal_flow` are **parent labels only** — each child entity has its own dedicated table
- No shared base table
- Relationships via foreign keys, not inheritance

### Why NOT Use Database Inheritance?

**Considered Patterns (Rejected):**

1. **Single Table Inheritance (STI)**
   - One `entities` table with `entity_type` discriminator
   - ❌ Rejected: Too many nullable columns for entity-specific fields
   - ❌ Rejected: Prisma doesn't support STI well
   - ❌ Rejected: Complex queries, hard to add entity-specific indexes

2. **Class Table Inheritance (CTI)**
   - Base `entities` table + specific tables (computers, routers, etc.)
   - ❌ Rejected: Requires joins for every query
   - ❌ Rejected: More complex migrations
   - ❌ Rejected: Prisma doesn't have native support

3. **Concrete Table Inheritance**
   - Separate tables with duplicated base fields
   - ✅ **CHOSEN**: This is what we're doing
   - ✅ Pro: Simple queries, no joins needed
   - ✅ Pro: Easy to add entity-specific fields
   - ✅ Pro: Prisma-friendly
   - ✅ Pro: Each table can have optimized indexes
   - ⚠️ Con: Base fields duplicated (but TypeScript enforces consistency)

**Our Approach:**
- TypeScript `BaseEntity` interface ensures consistency at code level
- Each Prisma model includes base fields: `id`, `production_id`, `created_at`, `updated_at`, `version`, `is_deleted`
- No runtime inheritance, just compile-time typing
- API/Frontend can treat them polymorphically via TypeScript

## 🔍 CURRENT STATE ANALYSIS

### Source Types & Categories

#### Current Implementation
```typescript
// Database: source_types table (settings) - SUPERSEDED
// Computer types are now equipment_specs entries with category = 'COMPUTER'
// No settings dropdown needed — user picks from equipment library filtered by COMPUTER category
//
// Equipment entries for computer types (seeded into equipment_specs):
// category: COMPUTER
[
  'Laptop - PC MISC', 'Laptop - PC GFX', 'Laptop - PC WIDE',
  'Laptop - MAC MISC', 'Laptop - MAC GFX',
  'Desktop - PC MISC', 'Desktop - PC GFX', 'Desktop - PC SERVER',
  'Desktop - MAC MISC', 'Desktop - MAC GFX', 'Desktop - MAC SERVER'
]
// category: MEDIA_SERVER (also seeded into equipment_specs)
// 'PC - Media Server' — base entry; Media Server modal has dropdown to choose computer type

// Entity Categories (from equipment_specs.category):
type EquipmentCategory = 'COMPUTER' | 'MEDIA_SERVER' | 'CAMERA' | 'CCU'
  | 'SWITCHER' | 'ROUTER' | 'LED_PROCESSOR' | 'CONVERTER' | 'CAMERA_SWITCHER'
  | 'MONITOR' | 'RECORDER' | 'PROJECTOR' | 'LED_TILE';
// Functional Categorization (Signal Path Roles):
// - SOURCES: COMPUTER, MEDIA_SERVER, CAMERA, CCU (generate signals)
// - SIGNAL_FLOW: SWITCHER, ROUTER, LED_PROCESSOR, CONVERTER, CAMERA_SWITCHER (route/process signals)
// - SENDS: monitor, recorder, projector, led_tile (receive/display signals)
//
// Note: Equipment can have loop-through ports (source device with send capability,
// or send device with source capability). These are managed in signal flow via
// connections table, not as separate entity types.
// Schema: sources table (generic container, NOT inheritance base)
model sources {
  uuid                   String   @id
  id                     String            // "SRC 1"
  production_id          String            // ← FIELD: FK column (stores the string)
  category               String?           // Base category
  type                   String            // Settings-defined type
  name                   String
  // ... format fields
  connections            connections[]
  source_outputs         source_outputs[]
  productions            productions @relation // ← RELATION: Prisma accessor
  //                     ^^^^^^^^^^^
  //                     This lets you query: await prisma.sources.findUnique({
  //                       where: { uuid },
  //                       include: { productions: true } // ← Gets full production object
  //                     });
}
```

**Note on Prisma Syntax:**
- `production_id String` = Database column (holds the FK value)
- `productions productions @relation(...)` = Prisma relation (lets you query related object)
- In code: `source.production_id` = string like "prod-123"
- With include: `source.productions` = full object `{ id: "prod-123", client: "ABC", ... }`

#### Relationships Currently in Sources
1. **Production Relationship** ✅
   - FK: `production_id` → `productions.id`
   - Cascade delete enabled
   - Indexed

2. **Source Outputs** ✅ (Child relationship)
   - One-to-many: `sources` → `source_outputs`
   - FK: `source_outputs.source_uuid` → `sources.uuid`
   - Cascade delete enabled

3. **Connections** ✅ (Referenced by)
   - One-to-many: `sources` → `connections`
   - FK: `connections.source_uuid` → `sources.uuid`
   - Dual storage: stores both `source_uuid` AND `source_id` for display

#### Planned Relationships for Sources
- [ ] **Equipment Specs** (NOT YET IMPLEMENTED)
  - Sources should reference Equipment for make/model
  - Pattern: Store `equipment_uuid` + `equipment_id` (manufacturer + model)
  - Example: Computer source → Equipment (manufacturer: "Apple", model: "MacBook Pro")

- [ ] **Category-Specific Types** (PARTIAL)
  - Computer → **selected from equipment library** (category = COMPUTER, replaces settings dropdown)
  - Media Server → **PC - Media Server** entry in equipment library; modal dropdown lets user choose underlying computer type
  - Camera → reference to equipment_specs
  - CCU → reference to equipment_specs

#### Output Architecture (DECISION MADE)

**Universal I/O Pattern: Direct + Optional Card-Based**

**Core Principle:**
- **EVERY device has direct I/O** (at minimum for IP control, reference, primary outputs)
- **Card-based I/O capability is defined at the equipment_specs level** — if a device references the equipment library, its card-based I/O configuration is inherited from there
- **Computers and Media Servers:** Have equipment_specs entries (seeded by type), but their specific I/O (outputs, connectors, formats) is configured per-production by the user — the equipment entry provides the type/category, not a predefined port layout
- Enables modular expansion and custom configurations

**I/O Structure:**

1. **Direct I/O** (always available)
   - Built into device hardware
   - Examples: Reference in/out, control ports, primary outputs
   - Tables: `{entity}_outputs`, `{entity}_inputs`
   - Simple relationship: device → direct I/O

2. **Card-Based I/O** (optional, defined per equipment type)
   - Removable expansion cards
   - **For equipment-library devices** (cameras, CCUs, camera switchers, switchers, routers, LED processors, converters): card capability is fully defined in `equipment_specs`
   - **For computers and media servers:** equipment entry defines the type; user configures actual I/O per production instance. Card config (if applicable) still comes from equipment_specs but user-defined outputs are added on top
   - Hierarchy: device → cards → card I/O
   - Tables: `{entity}_cards` → `{entity}_card_outputs` / `{entity}_card_inputs`

**I/O Properties (ALL inputs/outputs have these):**
- `connector` (String) - Connector type (HDMI, SDI, DP, etc.)
- `h_res` (Int) - Horizontal resolution
- `v_res` (Int) - Vertical resolution  
- `rate` (Float) - Frame rate
- `id` (String) - Display label ("OUT 1", "IN 3")
- `uuid` (String) - Unique identifier
- `is_card_based` (Boolean) - False for direct I/O, True for card-based
- `card_uuid` (String?) - NULL for direct I/O, references parent card if card-based

**Current Implementation:**
- ✅ `source_outputs` table exists for direct I/O
- ❌ Need card enablement configuration (device settings)
- ❌ Need card management tables
- ❌ Need to extend to all device types

### Sends Category

#### Current Implementation
```typescript
// Database: sends table
model sends {
  uuid         String   @id
  id           String            // "SEND 1"
  production_id    String
  type             String        // SendType from settings
  name             String
  // ... format fields
  output_connector String?
  productions      productions @relation
  
  @@index([production_id, is_deleted])
  @@index([type])
}

// Types
type SendType = 
  | 'VIDEO SWITCH' 
  | 'ROUTER' 
  | 'LED PROCESSOR' 
  | 'PROJECTOR'
  | 'MONITOR'
  | 'RECORD'
  | 'STREAM'
  | 'OTHER';
```

#### Relationships Currently in Sends
1. **Production Relationship** ✅
   - FK: `production_id` → `productions.id`
   - Cascade delete enabled
   - Indexed

#### Missing Relationships for Sends
- [ ] **Send Inputs** (NOT YET IMPLEMENTED)
  - Pattern should mirror `source_outputs`
  - Schema needed: `send_inputs` table
  - One-to-many: `sends` → `send_inputs`
  - Each input has: id, connector, format, feed

- [ ] **Connections** (PARTIALLY IMPLEMENTED)
  - Sends should be destinations in connections table
  - Current: `connections.destination_type` + `destination_id`
  - Need: `destination_uuid` FK to various send entities

- [ ] **Equipment Specs** (NOT YET IMPLEMENTED)
  - Routers, switchers, LED processors → Equipment
  - Pattern: `equipment_uuid` + `equipment_id`

#### Input Architecture (DECISION MADE)

**All devices can have definable inputs (not just sends):**

**Input Format Inheritance (DECISION MADE):**
- ✅ **Inputs inherit format from their connected output**
- Inputs accept what they receive - no format conversion at input
- Format conversion happens INSIDE the device, AFTER input
- Converted format appears on device outputs, not inputs
- Example signal chain:
  - Camera outputs 4K (3840x2160@60) → Input receives 4K
  - Scaler device processes internally → Output sends 1080p (1920x1080@60)
  - LED input receives 1080p

**Input Properties (ALL inputs have these):**
- `connector` (String) - Connector type (HDMI, SDI, DP, etc.)
- `h_res` (Int) - Horizontal resolution (inherited from connected output)
- `v_res` (Int) - Vertical resolution (inherited from connected output)
- `rate` (Float) - Frame rate (inherited from connected output)
- `feed` (String?) - Display label of connected output ("CAM 1 OUT 1")
- `id` (String) - Display label ("IN 1", "IN 2")
- `uuid` (String) - Unique identifier
- `is_card_based` (Boolean) - Direct I/O vs card-based
- `card_uuid` (String?) - Parent card reference if card-based

### Signal Flow (Connections)

#### Current Implementation
```typescript
// Database: connections table
model connections {
  uuid         String   @id
  id           String
  production_id       String
  
  // Source side (dual storage)
  source_uuid         String?
  source_id           String?
  source_output_id    String?
  
  // Intermediate device (for multi-hop)
  intermediate_type   String?
  intermediate_id     String?
  intermediate_input  String?
  intermediate_output String?
  
  // Destination side
  destination_type    String      // Type of destination
  destination_id      String?
  
  signal_path         Json?       // Complex routing paths
  note                String?
  
  productions         productions @relation
  sources             sources? @relation    // Only sources have FK
  
  @@index([production_id])
  @@index([source_uuid])
}
```

#### Connection Relationships Currently
1. **Source FK** ✅
   - FK: `source_uuid` → `sources.uuid`
   - Dual storage with `source_id` for display

2. **Production FK** ✅
   - FK: `production_id` → `productions.id`

#### Missing Connection Relationships
- [ ] **Destination FK** (NOT YET IMPLEMENTED)
  - Need polymorphic relationship to sends
  - Options:
    1. Multiple FK columns: `router_uuid`, `led_uuid`, `projector_uuid`
    2. Single FK + type discriminator
    3. Keep as string reference (current, but weak)

- [ ] **Intermediate Device FK** (NOT YET IMPLEMENTED)
  - For multi-hop connections (Source → Router → Switcher → LED)
  - Similar pattern to destination

## 🎯 PLANNING: RELATIONSHIP ARCHITECTURE

### Signal Flow Fundamentals (DECISION MADE)

**Core Principle: Outputs Connect to Inputs via Cables**

All connections follow the pattern: `OUTPUT → CABLE → INPUT`

**Important Notes:**
- Connections are made via physical cables (to be defined later with types and lengths)
- Sources CAN have send capabilities (loop-through ports)
- Sends CAN have source capabilities (loop-through ports)
- These loop-through capabilities are managed in I/O definitions, not as separate entity types

**Entity I/O Patterns:**

1. **Sources** (signal generators)
   - Primarily: OUTPUTS
   - Optional: INPUTS (for loop-through)
   - Examples: computers, media servers, cameras, CCUs
   - Tables: `{entity}_outputs` per child type (e.g. `camera_outputs`, `ccu_outputs`)

2. **Sends** (signal receivers/displays)
   - Primarily: INPUTS
   - Optional: OUTPUTS (for loop-through)
   - Examples: monitors, recorders, projectors, LED tiles
   - Tables: `send_inputs`, `send_outputs` (optional)

3. **Signal Flow Devices** (signal processors/routers)
   - Have: BOTH inputs AND outputs
   - Examples: switchers, routers, converters, LED processors, camera switchers
   - Tables: 
     - `switcher_inputs` + `switcher_outputs`
     - `router_inputs` + `router_outputs`
     - `converter_inputs` + `converter_outputs`
     - `led_processor_inputs` + `led_processor_outputs`
     - `camera_switcher_inputs` + `camera_switcher_outputs`

**Signal Path Example:**
```
Camera (source)
  OUT 1 →
        Router (signal flow)
          IN 3 → [internal routing] → OUT 12 →
                                              Switcher (signal flow)
                                                IN 5 → [switching] → PGM OUT →
                                                                               LED Processor (signal flow)
                                                                                 IN 1 → [processing] → OUT 1 →
                                                                                                             LED Wall (send)
                                                                                                               IN 1
```

**Connection Model Simplified:**
```prisma
model connections {
  uuid              String @id
  production_id     String
  
  // Simple output→cable→input pattern
  from_output_uuid  String   // ANY device's output
  from_output_id    String   // Display: "CAM 1 OUT 1"
  
  cable_uuid        String?  // Reference to cable (to be implemented)
  cable_id          String?  // Display: "CABLE 42" (dual storage)
  
  to_input_uuid     String   // ANY device's input  
  to_input_id       String   // Display: "LED 1 IN 1"
  
  // Signal path is just a chain of connections
  // Multi-hop = multiple connection records
}

model cables {
  uuid              String @id
  id                String   // Display: "CABLE 1"
  production_id     String
  cable_type        String   // HDMI, SDI, DP, etc.
  length_feet       Float?
  note              String?
  
  connections       connections[]
}
```

### Design Questions to Answer

#### 1. Source-to-Equipment Relationship
**Current:** Sources use string `type` field  
**Desired:** Sources reference Equipment specs

**Options:**
- **A)** Add `equipment_uuid` + `equipment_id` to sources table
  - Pro: Clean FK relationship, can query equipment details
  - Con: Not all sources have equipment (e.g., NDI, software)
  
- **B)** Keep type as string, use Equipment as optional reference
  - Pro: Flexibility for software sources
  - Con: Inconsistent data model
  
- **C)** Create category-specific tables (computers, media_servers)
  - Pro: Proper normalization for each category
  - Con: More complex schema, need migrations

**Recommendation:** TBD - needs discussion

---

#### 2. Send Inputs Architecture
**Current:** Sends have no input tracking  
**Desired:** Track inputs like sources track outputs

**Pattern to Follow:**
```typescript
// Mirror source_outputs pattern
model send_inputs {
  uuid         String   @id
  id           String            // "IN 1", "IN 2"
  send_uuid    String
  send_id      String            // Redundant for display
  connector    String
  input_index  Int      @default(1)
  h_res        Int?
  v_res        Int?
  rate         Float?
  feed         String?           // What's connected
  created_at   DateTime @default(now())
  version      Int      @default(1)
  sends        sends @relation(fields: [send_uuid], references: [uuid], onDelete: Cascade)

  @@index([send_uuid])
}
```

**Questions:**
- Should inputs inherit format from connected source?
- Track format per input or per send?
- How to handle routers with 16+ inputs?

---

#### 3. Polymorphic Connections (Biggest Design Decision)
**Current:** String-based destination with no FK  
**Desired:** Type-safe relationships

**Challenge:** Prisma doesn't natively support polymorphic relations

**Options:**

##### Option A: Multiple FK Columns (Explicit)
```prisma
model connections {
  // ... existing fields
  
  // Destination polymorphism
  destination_type    String
  router_uuid         String?
  switcher_uuid       String?
  led_processor_uuid  String?
  projector_uuid      String?
  monitor_uuid        String?
  
  routers         routers? @relation(fields: [router_uuid], references: [uuid])
  switchers       switchers? @relation(fields: [switcher_uuid], references: [uuid])
  // ... more relations
}
```
**Pros:**
- ✅ True FK constraints
- ✅ Type-safe at database level
- ✅ Clear relationships in schema

**Cons:**
- ❌ Many nullable columns
- ❌ Need to add column for each new entity type
- ❌ Complex queries (OR across multiple columns)

##### Option B: JSON Reference (Current + Enhanced)
```prisma
model connections {
  // ... existing fields
  destination_type    String
  destination_uuid    String?   // No FK constraint
  destination_id      String?
  
  destination_meta    Json?     // Store entity details snapshot
}
```
**Pros:**
- ✅ Flexible schema
- ✅ Easy to add new entity types
- ✅ Simple queries

**Cons:**
- ❌ No database-level integrity
- ❌ Can't cascade deletes
- ❌ Need application-level referential integrity

##### Option C: Intermediary Join Table
```prisma
model connection_destinations {
  uuid            String @id
  connection_uuid String
  entity_type     String    // 'router' | 'switcher' | etc.
  entity_uuid     String
  entity_id       String
  input_id        String?
  
  connection      connections @relation
  
  @@index([entity_uuid])
}
```
**Pros:**
- ✅ Normalized structure
- ✅ Easy to query by entity
- ✅ Can add metadata per destination

**Cons:**
- ❌ Extra join required
- ❌ More complex queries
- ❌ Still no true FK to polymorphic targets

**Recommendation:** TBD - needs discussion

---

#### 4. Multi-Hop Signal Paths
**Current:** Single intermediate device fields  
**Desired:** Track full signal path (Source → Router → Switcher → LED)

**Options:**

##### Option A: Array of Hops (JSON)
```typescript
signal_path: [
  {
    hop: 1,
    entityType: 'router',
    entityUuid: 'uuid-1',
    entityId: 'RTR 1',
    inputId: 'IN 3',
    outputId: 'OUT 12'
  },
  {
    hop: 2,
    entityType: 'switcher',
    entityUuid: 'uuid-2',
    entityId: 'SW 1',
    inputId: 'IN 1',
    outputId: 'PGM'
  }
]
```

##### Option B: Separate Hops Table
```prisma
model connection_hops {
  uuid            String @id
  connection_uuid String
  hop_number      Int
  entity_type     String
  entity_uuid     String
  entity_id       String
  input_id        String?
  output_id       String?
  
  connection      connections @relation
  
  @@index([connection_uuid, hop_number])
}
```

**Questions:**
- How common are multi-hop paths?
- Performance vs normalization trade-off?
- UI complexity for editing multi-hop paths?

## �️ EDID ARCHITECTURE (DECISION MADE)

### What is an EDID?

**EDID (Extended Display Identification Data)** is a metadata standard that inputs use to advertise their capabilities to the connected output device. In production environments, EDIDs are used to control what resolution, frame rate, and connector type a source outputs to a particular destination.

### Where EDIDs Live

- **Signal Flow Device Inputs** — each input has an EDID definition
- **Send Device Inputs** — each input has an EDID definition
- _(Source outputs do NOT have EDIDs — they generate signal, inputs receive it)_

### EDID Definition Options (per input)

Each input offers two ways to define its EDID:

**Option A: Custom User-Defined EDID**
- User manually enters: resolution (h_res × v_res), frame rate, connector type
- Stored directly on the input record
- Maximum flexibility for non-standard configurations

**Option B: Select from EDID Library**
- Admin-maintained table of named EDID presets (e.g. "1080p60 HDMI", "4K30 SDI")
- User picks from a list; all properties auto-populated from the preset
- `edid_preset_uuid` stored on the input record (dual storage with resolved values)

### EDID Schema (on every input record)

```typescript
model {entity}_inputs {
  uuid              String  @id
  // ... existing fields ...

  // EDID configuration
  edid_mode         String  @default("inherit")  // "inherit" | "custom" | "preset"
  edid_preset_uuid  String?                       // FK → edid_presets.uuid (when mode = "preset")
  edid_connector    String?                       // Connector type override (HDMI, SDI, DP, etc.)
  edid_h_res        Int?                          // Override horizontal resolution
  edid_v_res        Int?                          // Override vertical resolution
  edid_rate         Float?                        // Override frame rate

  edid_presets      edid_presets? @relation(fields: [edid_preset_uuid], references: [uuid])
}

### EDID Resolution Chain (Signal Tracing)

When `edid_mode = "inherit"`, the system traces the connection chain **back to the source** to determine the effective format for that input:

```
Source Output (defines format: connector, h_res, v_res, rate)
  → Cable
    → Signal Flow Device Input (EDID: inherit → reads from source output)
      → [internal processing]
      → Signal Flow Device Output (may convert format)
        → Cable
          → Send Device Input (EDID: inherit → reads from upstream output)
```

**Trace logic:**
1. Look at the input's connected output (`from_output_uuid`)
2. Read that output's `connector`, `h_res`, `v_res`, `rate`
3. If the upstream output belongs to a signal flow device, it may have a different format than what entered the device (conversion happened internally)
4. Follow chain until source output is reached
5. Populate inherited EDID values for display purposes (stored as resolved cache, refreshed on connection change)

### Connection Validation Rules

When a connection is created (`from_output_uuid → to_input_uuid`), apply these checks:

**Rule 1: Connector Compatibility**
- The output's `connector` type must be compatible with the input's defined connector
- Hard block (error) if connectors are physically incompatible (e.g. SDI output → HDMI input)
- Warn (soft warning) if adapters are typically required (e.g. DP → HDMI)
- Define a compatibility matrix in settings or constants

**Rule 2: Resolution Validity**
- If the input has a custom or preset EDID, the source output's resolution must match or be within the input's accepted range
- Warn if formats differ (e.g. source outputs 4K but input EDID is 1080p) — the device may scale, but user should be aware

**Rule 3: Frame Rate Match**
- If the input specifies a frame rate via EDID, the connection should match
- Warn on mismatch (e.g. source outputs 59.94 but input EDID is 50)

**Rule 4: Signal Format Chain Continuity**
- On multi-hop paths, validate format at each hop
- If a signal flow device's output format differs from its input format (conversion), flag this in the signal path UI so operators know where conversions occur

**Validation Response Pattern:**
```typescript
type ConnectionValidationResult = {
  valid: boolean;
  errors: ConnectionError[];    // Hard blocks — prevent connection
  warnings: ConnectionWarning[]; // Soft warnings — allow but inform
}

type ConnectionError = {
  code: 'CONNECTOR_INCOMPATIBLE' | 'FORMAT_MISMATCH_HARD';
  message: string;
  from: { uuid: string; id: string; connector: string; format: string };
  to:   { uuid: string; id: string; connector: string; format: string };
}

type ConnectionWarning = {
  code: 'CONNECTOR_ADAPTER_NEEDED' | 'RESOLUTION_MISMATCH' | 'FRAMERATE_MISMATCH' | 'FORMAT_CONVERSION_PRESENT';
  message: string;
}
```

### EDID Presets Table (Admin-Managed)

Sample presets to seed the EDID library:

| Name | Connector | Resolution | Frame Rate |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1080p60 HDMI | HDMI | 1920×1080 | 60 |
| 1080p59.94 HDMI | HDMI | 1920×1080 | 59.94 |
| 1080i59.94 SDI | SDI | 1920×1080i | 59.94 |
| 1080p50 SDI | SDI | 1920×1080 | 50 |
| 4K30 HDMI | HDMI | 3840×2160 | 30 |
| 4K60 DP | DP | 3840×2160 | 60 |
| 1080p60 NDI | NDI | 1920×1080 | 60 |

**Date:** February 28, 2026  
**Decision:** EDID system for signal flow and send device inputs  
**Details:**
- Every input on a signal flow or send device has an EDID configuration
- Three modes: `inherit` (trace from source), `custom` (manual override), `preset` (from EDID library)
- Admin manages EDID preset library (name + connector + resolution + frame rate)
- Connection creation triggers validation: connector compatibility, resolution match, frame rate match
- Validation: hard errors block connection; soft warnings allow but inform
- Multi-hop format trace follows the full signal chain back to source output
**Rationale:** Reflects real-world AV production workflow. EDIDs are critical for ensuring signals are accepted by receiving devices. Validation prevents misconfigured signal paths.

- [ ] Simplify connections table:
  - `from_output_uuid` + `from_output_id` (dual storage)
  - `cable_uuid` + `cable_id` (dual storage, optional for now)
  - `to_input_uuid` + `to_input_id` (dual storage)
  - Remove polymorphic FK complexity
- [ ] Implement connection validation service:
  - Hard error: connector incompatibility (e.g. SDI → HDMI)
  - Soft warning: resolution mismatch, frame rate mismatch
  - Soft warning: adapter required (e.g. DP → HDMI)
  - Format chain trace: walk multi-hop path back to source
- [ ] Create `cables` table (cable types, lengths - to be implemented later)
- [ ] Multi-hop paths = multiple connection records (not single record with hops)
- [ ] Add CRUD API for connections
- [ ] Test cascade deletes (when device deleted, connections should handle gracefully)

## 📝 NOTES & DECISIONS

*(Use this section during discussion to record choices)*

### Decision Log

**Date:** February 28, 2026  
**Decision:** Clarified BaseEntity is TypeScript-only, not database inheritance  
**Rationale:** Single Table Per Entity pattern is simpler, more flexible, and avoids polymorphic complexity in Prisma

**Date:** February 28, 2026  
**Decision:** Computer types and Media Server moved from settings dropdown to equipment_specs library  
**Details:**
- All computer types seeded as `equipment_specs` entries with category = COMPUTER:
  - Laptop × {PC MISC, PC GFX, PC WIDE, MAC MISC, MAC GFX}
  - Desktop × {PC MISC, PC GFX, PC SERVER, MAC MISC, MAC GFX, MAC SERVER}
- 'PC - Media Server' added as equipment entry with category = MEDIA_SERVER
- Computer source modal: user selects type from equipment library (filtered by COMPUTER) — no settings dropdown
- Media Server modal: dropdown to choose underlying computer type from equipment library
- Settings `computerTypes` / `source_types` dropdown removed
- Equipment entries define the type/category; user still configures specific I/O per production instance
**Rationale:** Centralises device definitions in one place. Richer data model (manufacturer, specs, card config) vs a plain string dropdown.

**Date:** February 28, 2026  
**Decision:** Entity categorization clarified:  
- **Sources** _(parent label, each is its own table)_: Computer, Media Server, Camera, CCU  
- **Signal Flow** _(parent label, each is its own table)_: Switcher (Vision Switcher), Router, LED Processor, Converter, Camera Switcher  
- **Sends:** Monitor, Recorder, Projector, LED Tile  
**Rationale:** Reflects actual signal path roles in production workflow. Camera Switcher routes/switches camera feeds — it belongs in Signal Flow, not Sources.

**Date:** February 28, 2026  
**Decision:** Output Architecture - Direct I/O vs Card-Based  
**Details:**
- Card-based I/O capability is defined at the `equipment_specs` level for all equipment-library devices
- All devices have equipment_specs entries; card config is inherited from there
- Computers & media servers: equipment entry defines type/category; user configures actual I/O (outputs, connectors, formats) per production instance
- Devices that support card-based I/O: media servers, switchers, LED processors, streaming devices (declared in equipment_specs)
- All outputs have: connector, h_res, v_res, rate, id, uuid
**Rationale:** Equipment library is the single source of truth for device capabilities.

**Date:** February 28, 2026  
**Decision:** UX Requirements for Outputs and Entity Creation  
**Requirements:**
1. Outputs must have "Duplicate" button for efficient configuration
2. Source/Send forms need "Save & Duplicate" option
3. Reduces repetitive data entry for similar devices
**Rationale:** Improves workflow efficiency when configuring multiple similar devices

**Date:** February 28, 2026  
**Decision:** Signal Flow Architecture - Outputs Connect to Inputs  
**Details:**
- Sources have outputs only (signal generators)
- Sends have inputs only (signal receivers)
- Signal flow devices have BOTH inputs and outputs (processors/routers)
- Connection model: `from_output_uuid` → `to_input_uuid`
- Multi-hop paths = chain of connection records (not single record with embedded hops)
**Rationale:** Matches real-world signal flow. Simplifies connection logic. Any output can connect to any input. Avoids polymorphic FK complexity.

**Date:** February 28, 2026  
**Decision:** Separate tables per device type for I/O (Option A)  
**Details:**
- Each device type gets dedicated input/output tables
- Examples: `switcher_inputs`, `switcher_outputs`, `router_inputs`, `router_outputs`
- Enables drag-and-drop between devices of same type (future feature)
- Signal flow devices have paired tables (both inputs AND outputs)
**Rationale:** Type-safe, allows device-specific features, clearer schema, better than generic table with discriminator

**Date:** February 28, 2026  
**Decision:** Connections via Cables (Physical Layer)  
**Details:**
- Connections model: OUTPUT → CABLE → INPUT
- Cable entity to be defined later with types (HDMI, SDI, DP) and lengths
- Connection table references cable_uuid + cable_id (dual storage)
- Sources CAN have send capabilities (loop-through)
- Sends CAN have source capabilities (loop-through)
**Rationale:** Reflects physical reality of production environments. Cable management is critical for troubleshooting.

**Date:** February 28, 2026  
**Decision:** Universal Direct I/O + Equipment-Level Card-Based I/O  
**Details:**
- ALL devices have direct I/O (minimum for control, reference, primary outputs)
- Card-based I/O capability is defined at the `equipment_specs` level
- All production devices reference equipment_specs; card config flows from the equipment definition
- Computers & Media Servers have seeded equipment entries (type/category only); their specific I/O is configured per-production by the user
- Cards are children of devices: device → cards → card I/O
- Both direct and card-based I/O use the same property schema
**Rationale:** Equipment library is the single source of truth for device capabilities. Computer/media server outputs vary by production build, so the equipment entry defines type while the user configures I/O.

**Date:** February 28, 2026  
**Decision:** Input Format Inheritance (Option A)  
**Details:**
- Inputs inherit format from connected output
- Inputs passively receive signal format - no conversion at input
- Format conversion happens INSIDE the device, AFTER input is received
- Device outputs reflect converted format, not inputs
- Example: 4K input → scaler → 1080p output
**Rationale:** Matches physical reality. Inputs accept what they're given. Conversion is an internal device function that affects outputs.

---

**Status:** Planning complete - All major architecture decisions made!  
**Updated:** February 28, 2026 - Added EDID architecture; Camera Switcher correctly placed in Signal Flow; Sources = Computer, Media Server, Camera, CCU; computer types + PC - Media Server moved to equipment_specs library (replaces settings dropdown); card-based I/O defined at equipment_specs level  
**Next Action:** Phase 2 implementation — signal flow device input/output tables + EDID fields
