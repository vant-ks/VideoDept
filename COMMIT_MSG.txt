fix: enforce camelCase contract throughout frontend, fix dates display

CRITICAL: Frontend must NEVER access snake_case fields - API sends camelCase

Root Cause Analysis:
- Frontend was mapping from snake_case after API already sent camelCase
- Spread operators leaked snake_case properties into clean objects
- WebSocket listeners assumed snake_case when API broadcast camelCase
- Result: daysBeforeShow became undefined, dates never displayed

Violations Fixed:
1. useProjectStore.ts (7 locations):
   - Lines 213-227: Fixed GET endpoint checklist mapping
   - Lines 313-327: Fixed alternate GET endpoint mapping
   - Lines 204-211: Fixed production field mapping (loadIn, loadOut, showInfoUrl)
   - Lines 302-309: Fixed alternate production mapping
   - Lines 530-542: Fixed saveProject fieldVersions response
   - Lines 600-607: Fixed force save fieldVersions
   - Lines 639-640: Fixed conflict detection updatedAt
   - Lines 855-863: Fixed syncWithAPI production mapping
   - Lines 890-907: Fixed syncWithAPI log statements

2. useProductionSync.ts (3 locations):
   - Line 46: Fixed lastModifiedBy fallback
   - Lines 90-97: Fixed production field mapping in merge
   - Lines 124-127: Removed debug log checking snake_case

3. Projects.tsx (2 locations):
   - Lines 68-73: Fixed production list creation
   - Lines 112-117: Fixed production update handler

4. apiClient.ts (1 location):
   - Lines 150-158: Removed debug log checking snake_case

5. Checklist.tsx (2 fixes):
   - Lines 176-210: Fixed spread operator in addChecklistItem
   - Lines 211-223: Removed category collapse on task toggle

6. useProjectStore.ts addChecklistItem (1 location):
   - Lines 1065-1084: Built clean object instead of spreading item

Bug Fixes:
- Checklist dates now display with colored badges
- Task completion no longer collapses categories
- Overall Progress card updates on task toggle
- Item deletion persists across refresh
- Load in/out dates save correctly in production creation

Store Architecture Fix:
- useChecklistProgress now reads from activeProject (useProjectStore)
- Previously read from old store causing stale progress stats
- Added import of useProjectStore to useStore.ts

Documentation:
- PROJECT_RULES.md: Added architectural justification for server-side transforms
- Updated mission statement with SERVER-SIDE TRANSFORMATION CONTRACT
- Documented why server-side (not client-side) transform is correct:
  * Single source of truth
  * WebSocket efficiency (broadcast once, works for all)
  * Lower client CPU usage
  * Less error-prone (N routes vs N×M×P listeners)
  * Industry standard

Debug Logging Added:
- API: Database return values and broadcast payloads
- Frontend: GET endpoint responses, form values, WebSocket receipts
- Traced full data flow from DB → API → WebSocket → Frontend

Architectural Decision:
Server-side transformation is the correct approach:
  Client → Server: Always send camelCase
  Server → Client: Always receive camelCase (via toCamelCase)
  Database: Always stores snake_case

Self-Audit Commands (PROJECT_RULES.md):
  grep -rn 'apiClient.(create|update)' src/ | grep '_'
  grep -rn 'subscribe.*data.' src/hooks/useProductionSync.ts | grep '_'

Testing Verified:
- Created new production with dates
- Dates display correctly with color coding (red ≤7d, yellow ≤14d)
- Progress card updates immediately on toggle
- Delete persists across refresh
- Multi-browser sync works (dates visible in both browsers)
