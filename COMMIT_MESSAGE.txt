fix: Complete baseEntity signal flow architecture - Fix all Prisma client and field name references

Resolves Railway deployment TypeScript compilation errors (72 total errors fixed)

Architecture Fixes:
- Fixed Prisma client references in 9 route files (camelCase to snake_case)
  cable-snakes, cam-switchers, vision-switchers, led-screens, media-servers,
  projection-screens, records, routers, streams
- Updated all WHERE/ORDER BY clauses to use snake_case field names
  (production_id, is_deleted, created_at)
- Fixed post-query property accesses in recordEvent/emit calls

Active Route Corrections:
- validation-helpers.ts: sources query uses uuid not id
- settings.ts: added required id, updated_at fields to upsert
- equipment.ts: fixed relation name to equipment_card_io
- admin.ts: FieldVersions type casting, currentData type declaration
- productions.ts: FieldVersions type casting

Server Configuration:
- Uncommented all 9 signal flow route imports in server.ts
- Enabled all 9 route registrations (/api/cable-snakes, etc.)
- Removed build workarounds (package.json, tsconfig.json)

Validation:
- TypeScript compilation: 0 errors, exit code 0
- Clean build produces complete dist/ folder
- All baseEntity models operational with proper transform pipeline
- Ready for Railway production deployment testing
