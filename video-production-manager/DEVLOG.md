### Bug Fixes - Infinite Render Loop Resolution
- **Fixed** Critical infinite render loop in Settings page (Maximum update depth exceeded)
  - **Root cause:** ServerConnection renderStatus callback creating dependency cycle
  - renderStatus was inline arrow function → new reference on every Settings render
  - ServerConnection useEffect had renderStatus in deps → triggered on every change
  - Created loop: render → new callback → useEffect → setState → render
  
- **Solution:** Applied Option C (architectural improvements)
  1. Memoized renderStatus callback with useCallback in Settings.tsx
  2. Removed renderStatus from ServerConnection useEffect dependency array
  - Follows React best practices
  - Prevents similar issues in the future
  
- **Commits:**
  - c6f5bcb: Fix infinite render loop in Settings page
  - 5d17dde: Remove troubleshooting debug logs from Settings.tsx

### Field-Level Versioning - Phase 3 Complete ✅
- **Fixed** Conflict resolution force save bug
  - Variable scoping issue: updatedProject out of scope in catch block
  - Fixed by reconstructing project object from activeProject
  - Added proper error handling with try/catch and user feedback
  - Added IndexedDB sync for force saves

- **Enhanced** Conflict resolution dialog
  - Upgraded from confirm() (2 options) to prompt() (3 options)
  - Option 1: Retry - reload fresh data and manually merge
  - Option 2: Keep Yours - force save, overwrite their changes
  - Option 3: Keep Theirs - discard your changes, load their version
  
- **Testing Results:** All Phase 3 tests passing
  - ✅ Test 1: Single browser field edits working
  - ✅ Test 2: Two browsers different fields - auto-merge successful
  - ✅ Test 3: Two browsers same field - conflict detected, retry option works
  
- **Settings Page:** Production info form with 7 editable fields (showName, client, venue, room, loadIn, loadOut, showInfoUrl)
- **Dashboard:** Added pencil edit button that navigates to Settings
- **Architecture:** Database-first with dual-path API (field-level + record-level fallback)
  - 16/16 backend tests passing
  - 14 tracked fields with JSONB field_versions column
  - Automatic conflict detection and resolution
  - Manual refresh required until Phase 4 WebSocket implementation

### Bug Fixes & UX Improvements
- **Fixed** Settings page blank screen - added missing frameRates and resolutions initialization
- **Fixed** Source edit modal blank screen - added safety checks for undefined arrays
- **Disabled** auto-open browser on server restart
- **Improved** Settings UX: All sections now collapsed by default
- **Added** Settings section state persistence to localStorage (remembers user's expand/collapse preferences)

### Version Control & Logging System
- **Established** automatic git commit and push protocol for code changes
- **Created** DEVLOG.md for human-readable development history
- **Implemented** LogService for tracking application changes
  - Stores up to 1000 log entries in localStorage
  - Tracks settings additions, updates, deletions, and reordering
  - Tracks equipment additions, updates, deletions with change details
  - Includes timestamps, categories, and detailed change tracking
  
- **Created** Activity Logs page
  - Filter by category (all, settings, equipment, general)
  - Expandable entries showing field-level changes
  - Export logs as JSON
  - Clear logs functionality
  - Color-coded badges for categories and actions

### Centralized Settings Management
- **Removed** `secondaryDevices` from Settings - replaced with connector types from equipment converters
- **Added** Connector Types section to Settings
  - Initialized with: HDMI, SDI, DP, FIBER, NDI, USB-C
  - Drag-and-drop reordering with GripVertical handles
  - Add/remove capabilities with validation
  
- **Added** Frame Rates section to Settings
  - Initialized with: 60, 59.94, 50, 30, 29.97, 25, 24, 23.98
  - Drag-and-drop reordering
  - Add/remove capabilities
  
- **Added** Resolutions section to Settings

  - Drag-and-drop reordering
  - Add/remove capabilities

### Site-Wide Integration
- Updated all dropdown references to use centralized settings
- Equipment FORMAT_OPTIONS now dynamically built from resolutions × frameRates
- SourceFormModal uses centralized connectorTypes
- EquipmentFormModal uses centralized resolutions and frameRates
- Added safety checks for undefined arrays
- All changes automatically logged via LogService

### Bug Fixes
- Fixed blank window issue (Cameras page was de-referenced)
- Restored Cameras page with all original customizations intact
- Added cache clearing guidance

### Infrastructure
- **Protocol**: Automatically commit and push after code changes (unless user says "don't push")
- **Protocol**: Server restart after large alterations
- All 4 settings lists (Source Types, Connector Types, Frame Rates, Resolutions) support drag-and-drop reordering
- Changes in Settings automatically propagate throughout application
- All changes tracked in Activity Logs
