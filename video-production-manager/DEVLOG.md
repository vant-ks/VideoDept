# Development Log - Video Production Manager

## February 25, 2026 - Checklist API Migration & Full Functionality (v0.0.3)

### Checklist Page Modernization - Complete ✅

**Context**: Completed comprehensive migration of Checklist page from Zustand store pattern to modern API-first architecture with real-time WebSocket synchronization. This brings checklists to feature parity with other entities (Sources, Cameras, etc.).

**Decision Path**:
- Previous sessions had checklists working but using old Zustand store pattern (local state only)
- Other entities (Sources, Cameras, Sends, CCUs) already migrated to API-first pattern in Phase 5
- Need consistency: all entities should use same architecture pattern (API + WebSocket)
- Goal: Checklists should sync in real-time across browsers like other entities

**Implementation**:

1. **Created `useChecklistAPI.ts` Hook** (New File)
   - Mirrors pattern from `useCamerasAPI`, `useSourcesAPI`, etc.
   - Implements CRUD operations:
     - `fetchChecklistItems()` - Get all items for production
     - `createChecklistItem()` - Add new item
     - `updateChecklistItem()` - Edit existing item with version conflict detection
     - `deleteChecklistItem()` - Remove item
     - `toggleChecklistItem()` - Quick complete/incomplete toggle
   - Includes user context (userId, userName) for all mutations
   - Returns `ConflictError` type for version mismatch handling

2. **Migrated Checklist.tsx to API Pattern**
   - **Removed**: Direct Zustand store access (`useProductionStore().checklist`)
   - **Added**: Local React state + API hook + WebSocket subscriptions
   - **Fetch on Mount**: Calls `fetchChecklistItems()` when production loads
   - **Real-time Sync**: `useProductionEvents` for `entity:created`, `entity:updated`, `entity:deleted`
   - **Optimistic Updates**: UI updates immediately, WebSocket confirms
   - **Conflict Resolution**: Detects version mismatches, alerts user, refetches data

3. **Fixed Data Structures** (Array Handling)
   - **Issue**: `moreInfo` and `completionNote` fields are JSONB arrays in DB
   - **Fix**: Ensured frontend always sends/receives arrays (not strings)
   - **Safety Checks**: `Array.isArray()` checks before array operations
   - **Append Pattern**: New entries append to existing arrays (don't replace)
   - Structure: `[{ id, text, timestamp, type }]`

4. **Enhanced Notes UI**
   - **Expand/Collapse**: Long notes (>80 chars) show "..." with click to expand
   - **Type Badges**: Color-coded "Info" (blue) vs "Completion" (green) notes
   - **Timestamp**: Human-readable format (e.g., "Feb 25, 3:45 PM")
   - **Delete Button**: Per-note deletion with immediate update
   - **Scrollable History**: Max height with overflow for long histories

5. **UUID Matching Throughout**
   - Changed all item lookups from `.id` to `.uuid` (PRIMARY KEY)
   - Field `.id` remains user-editable identifier (e.g., "chk-1234567890")
   - WebSocket events match by `uuid` for reliability
   - Prevents duplicate entries and ensures proper sync

6. **Added Debug Logging** (checklist-items.ts API routes)
   - Logs data types at each transformation stage:
     - Raw from database (snake_case JSONB)
     - After `toCamelCase()` transformation
     - Sent in response
   - Helps diagnose array vs string issues
   - Can be removed in future cleanup if no longer needed

**Files Modified**:
- `video-production-manager/src/hooks/useChecklistAPI.ts` - NEW FILE (145 lines)
- `video-production-manager/src/pages/Checklist.tsx` - Complete rewrite (1,100+ lines)
- `video-production-manager/api/src/routes/checklist-items.ts` - Added debug logging

**Testing Status**: READY FOR TESTING
- [ ] Test 2 from MULTI_BROWSER_SYNC_TEST.md needs re-run
- [ ] Verify: Create checklist item in Browser A → appears in Browser B
- [ ] Verify: Edit notes appends correctly, shows in both browsers
- [ ] Verify: Toggle complete/incomplete syncs instantly
- [ ] Verify: Delete syncs immediately
- [ ] Verify: Version conflict detection shows alert

**Version**: v0.0.3

## February 25, 2026 - Media Servers Migration Started

### Schema Design for Playback Pairs

**Context**: Beginning API migration for media_servers table. Adding fields to support paired playback server architecture (primary + backup pairs).

**Schema Updates** (WIP):
- `pair_number` - INT: Identifies which pair (e.g., Pair 1, Pair 2)
- `is_backup` - BOOLEAN: True for backup server, false for primary
- `platform` - STRING: e.g., "Disguise", "Resolume", "Watchout"
- `outputs_data` - JSONB: Structured output configuration per server
- Added composite index: `(production_id, pair_number)`

**Status**: Schema defined, not yet migrated. Code updates pending.

**Next Steps**:
1. Generate Prisma migration
2. Apply to local database
3. Update media-servers.ts routes
4. Update MediaServers.tsx frontend
5. Update useMediaServersAPI hook
6. Test locally, then deploy

## February 22, 2026 - UUID Architecture Migration

### ID vs UUID Conflict Resolution

**Context**: Investigation revealed architectural conflict - `id` field is user-editable (can rename "SRC 1" → "SRC A") but was being used as PRIMARY KEY, causing sync issues and preventing ID changes.

**Root Cause Analysis**:
- **Feb 10, 2026**: UUID migration attempted but rolled back due to crashes
- **Feb 21, 2026**: ENTITY_DATA_FLOW_STANDARD.md created saying "use id as PRIMARY KEY"
- **Feb 21, 2026**: Sources.tsx updated to use `.id` for matching (assumes immutable)
- **Conflict**: User requirement is that ID is editable, but PRIMARY KEY must be immutable

**Historical Context** (from UUID_MIGRATION_RECOVERY.md):
- Original design: UUID as PRIMARY KEY, id as user-friendly display field
- Migration crashed: Code expected uuid, database didn't have it
- Rolled back: Used id as PRIMARY KEY (violated design intent)
- User confirmed: IDs should be editable, need proper UUID implementation

**Approved Solution** (Standard Industry Pattern):
- **uuid**: Auto-generated PRIMARY KEY by Postgres (@default(uuid()))
- **id**: User-editable display field (unique within production)
- **WebSocket**: Uses uuid for reliable matching (immutable)
- **Frontend**: Creates without uuid, receives it from database

## February 21, 2026 - Systematic Entity Data Flow Standardization

### Test 4 Source Sync - Revealed Systemic Pattern Violations

**Context**: Started Test 4 (Source Sync) and immediately hit 500 errors. Investigation revealed the camera sync fix from Feb 12 was never propagated to other entities, causing circular recurring bugs.

**Root Cause Analysis**:
- **Immediate Issue**: sync-helpers.ts emitted entity-specific events (`source:created`, `send:created`) but frontend listens for generic events (`entity:created`)
- **Systemic Issue**: Pattern violations recurring despite documentation in PROJECT_RULES.md
- **Historical Pattern**: Identical bug was fixed for cameras Feb 12 (Bug 3.2) but pattern wasn't enforced for new/existing entities
- **Affected Routes**: 6 routes using sync-helpers.ts (sources, sends, ccus, connections, checklist-items, ip-addresses)

**Systematic Solution Implemented**:

1. **Fixed sync-helpers.ts** - Changed from entity-specific to generic events:
   ```typescript
   // BEFORE (WRONG):
   const event = `${entityType}:created`;  // Creates "source:created"
   io.to(room).emit(event, data);
   
   // AFTER (CORRECT):
   const event = 'entity:created';  // Generic event
   io.to(room).emit(event, {
     entityType,
     entityId,
     entity: data
   });
   ```

2. **Fixed Sources.tsx** - Replaced `.uuid` references with `.id`:
   - Line 77: Changed duplicate check from `s.uuid` to `s.id` (PRIMARY KEY)
   - Line 89: Changed update matching from `s.uuid` to `s.id`
   - Line 96: Changed delete filtering from `s.uuid` to `s.id`
   - Removed all console.log references to uuid field

3. **Created Enforcement Mechanisms**:
   - **Validation Script**: `scripts/validate-entity-pattern.sh` checks:
     - ✅ WebSocket events use generic pattern (`entity:*` not `source:*`)
     - ✅ Frontend doesn't use `.uuid` field
     - ✅ sync-helpers.ts emits correct event names
     - ⚠️ API routes use toCamelCase (tracked as technical debt)
   - **Documentation**: Created [ENTITY_DATA_FLOW_STANDARD.md](../../docs/ENTITY_DATA_FLOW_STANDARD.md) with:
     - Complete 4-layer pattern (Database → API → Hooks → Pages)
     - Copy-paste templates for all layers
     - 22-point checklist for new entities
     - Migration plan for existing violations
   - **PROJECT_RULES.md**: Added Pillar #9 referencing standard and validation script

**Pattern Audit Results** (83 broadcast calls):
- ✅ **9 routes correct**: cameras, routers, cable-snakes, projection-screens, streams, records, media-servers, led-screens, vision-switchers
- ❌ **6 routes fixed**: sources, sends, ccus, connections, checklist-items, ip-addresses (via sync-helpers fix)
- ✅ **2 domain-specific**: productions (production:*), settings (settings:*) - correctly different

**Files Modified**:
- `video-production-manager/api/src/utils/sync-helpers.ts` - Fixed all 3 broadcast functions to emit generic events
- `video-production-manager/src/pages/Sources.tsx` - Changed .uuid to .id throughout
- `video-production-manager/docs/PROJECT_RULES.md` - Added Pillar #9, updated date to Feb 21, 2026
- `scripts/validate-entity-pattern.sh` - New validation script (executable)
- `docs/ENTITY_DATA_FLOW_STANDARD.md` - Complete reference implementation and checklist

**Success Criteria Met**:
- ✅ All 6 affected routes now use correct pattern
- ✅ Validation script passes all checks
- ✅ Pattern documented in 3 places (STANDARD, PROJECT_RULES, DEVLOG)
- ✅ Enforcement mechanism prevents future violations

**Next Steps**:
- Run Test 4 (Source Sync) to verify fix works end-to-end
- Continue Phase 5 multi-browser testing (Tests 5-10)
- Track toCamelCase technical debt for future cleanup session

## February 12, 2026 (Late Evening Session)

### Test 3: Camera Sync Complete ✅

**Context**: Completed Test 3 of Phase 5 multi-browser testing. Fixed two critical camera sync bugs.

**Issues Fixed**:

1. **Camera Delete Not Persisting** (Bug 3.1):
   - **Problem**: Camera deleted in Browser A reappeared after refresh
   - **Root Cause**: `handleDelete` only updated local state, didn't call API
   - **Fix**: Updated `handleDelete` to `async` function that calls `camerasAPI.deleteCamera()` before updating local state
   - **Commit**: 5d54e6e - "Fix camera delete to call API before updating local state"

2. **Real-Time Sync Not Working** (Bug 3.2):
   - **Problem**: Camera CRUD operations only visible after manual refresh
   - **Root Cause**: Camera API routes emitted specific `camera:created/updated/deleted` events, but frontend listened for generic `entity:created/updated/deleted` events
   - **Pattern Mismatch**: Sources, Sends, CCUs all use generic events; cameras was inconsistent
   - **Fix**: Updated cameras.ts routes to emit generic entity events matching pattern:
     - Changed: `broadcastEntityCreated()` → `io.to().emit('entity:created', {entityType: 'camera', ...})`
     - Changed: `broadcastEntityUpdate()` → `io.to().emit('entity:updated', {entityType: 'camera', ...})`
     - Changed: `broadcastEntityDeleted()` → `io.to().emit('entity:deleted', {entityType: 'camera', ...})`
   - **Commit**: c3b747f - "Fix camera WebSocket sync by using generic entity events"

**Test Results**: ✅ ALL PASSING
- ✅ Camera creation syncs instantly across browsers
- ✅ Camera edits sync in real-time without refresh
- ✅ Camera deletions sync immediately and persist through refresh
- ✅ No duplicates, no orphaned data
- ✅ Version conflicts detected properly

**Files Modified**:
- `video-production-manager/src/pages/Cameras.tsx` - Fixed handleDelete to call API
- `video-production-manager/api/src/routes/cameras.ts` - Standardized WebSocket events
- `docs/testing/MULTI_BROWSER_TESTING_PROCEDURES.md` - Documented bugs and fixes

**Next Steps**: Proceed to Test 4 (Source Sync) in next session

## February 12, 2026 (Evening Session)

### Multi-Browser Sync Testing - Test 2 Complete, Test 3 Camera Sync Fix ✅

**Context**: Continued Phase 5 multi-browser testing suite. Test 2 (Checklist sync) passed after bug fixes. Test 3 (Camera sync) revealed cameras weren't syncing across browsers.

**Test 2 (Checklist) - PASSING** ✅:
- Fixed 3 bugs from initial test:
  - Bug 2.1: Navigation issue (shows Media Servers instead of Dashboard) - Added `setActiveTab('dashboard')` on show open
  - Bug 2.2: Preference conflict warnings - Removed project-specific UI preferences, use global usePreferencesStore only  
  - Bug 2.3: Edit sync missing API call - Made updateChecklistItem async, added WebSocket broadcast
  - Bug 2.3b: Field name mismatch - Changed `item` to `title` in update payload
  - Bug 2.3c: Notes data format - Database columns already JSONB, fixed frontend to send JSON arrays instead of strings
- All checklist operations now sync correctly: add, delete, complete/incomplete, reveal/collapse, edit (title, assignTo, days, notes)
- Regenerated Prisma Client after schema was updated to recognize JSON columns

**Test 3 (Camera) - Fixed** ✅:
- **Issue**: Camera created in Browser A didn't sync to Browser B; refresh on A deleted the camera
- **Root Cause**: Cameras page wasn't using `useCamerasAPI` hook - only updating local state, no API call/WebSocket broadcast
- **Analysis**: Same pattern previously solved for Sources, Sends, CCUs - some entities weren't migrated to new API architecture
- **Solution Implemented**:
  1. Integrated `useCamerasAPI` hook into Cameras page
  2. Updated `handleSave` to:
     - Call `camerasAPI.createCamera()` for new cameras (properly saves to database)
     - Call `camerasAPI.updateCamera()` for edits (with version conflict detection)
     - Perform optimistic updates to local state for responsive UI
  3. Added `useProductionEvents` WebSocket listener:
     - `onEntityCreated`: Add camera to local state when created by other users
     - `onEntityUpdated`: Update camera when edited by other users
     - `onEntityDeleted`: Remove camera when deleted by other users
  4. Updated `useCamerasAPI` interface to support:
     - Custom IDs (e.g., "CAM 1", "CAM 2") - added `id?` optional field
     - Model field from equipment specs - added `model?` field
  5. Switched component to use `localCameras` state that syncs via WebSocket instead of direct store access

**UI Improvements** ✨:
1. **Search Bar Clear Buttons**: Added X icon to all search fields across app to clear search and release filters
   - Files modified: Checklist, Equipment, Logs, IPManagement, Sources, Sends (both search bars)
   - Pattern: Relative container with absolute positioned X button (only shows when text entered)
   
2. **Checklist Page Redesign**:
   - Added search bar below summary card (searches: title, notes, assignedTo)
   - Converted category quick-select buttons to dropdown list (cleaner, matches Equipment page)
   - Integrated completion counters into group titles (e.g., "Screens (3/5)")
   - Repositioned Add Item button to far right of group headers (larger, more prominent)
   - Moved progress bar between counter and Add button

**Files Modified**:
- `src/pages/Cameras.tsx`: Integrated useCamerasAPI and useProductionEvents for sync
- `src/hooks/useCamerasAPI.ts`: Added `id?` and `model?` fields to CreateCameraInput interface
- `src/pages/Checklist.tsx`: Search bar, dropdown, UI layout improvements
- `src/pages/Equipment.tsx`: Added search clear button
- `src/pages/Logs.tsx`: Added search clear button (with X import)
- `src/pages/IPManagement.tsx`: Added search clear button (with X import)
- `src/pages/Sources.tsx`: Added search clear button (with X import)
- `src/pages/Sends.tsx`: Added search clear buttons (2 locations - sends and projection screens, with X import)

**Git Commits**:
- `48bf9d3` - Fix checklist notes data format - send JSON arrays to API instead of raw strings
- `66efaae` - Improve checklist UI: add search bar, convert category buttons to dropdown, integrate counters into group titles
- `96e877a` - Add X clear button to all search fields across application
- `6b06d5e` - Fix Camera sync: integrate useCamerasAPI and useProductionEvents for proper database save and WebSocket broadcast

**Testing Status**:
- ✅ Test 2: Checklist Sync - PASSING (all features work, notes now display correctly)
- ✅ Test 3: Camera Sync - READY FOR RETEST (API integration complete, needs user verification)
- ⏭️ Tests 4-10: Pending (Source, Send, CCU, Connections, Offline, Conflicts, Rapid Updates)

**Key Architectural Pattern Confirmed**:
- **Preference vs Data Sync**:
  - UI preferences (collapse/expand, theme, tabs) → `usePreferencesStore` (localStorage, user-specific, NOT synced)
  - Production data (entities, settings) → `useProjectStore`/`useProductionStore` (database, WebSocket synced)
  - Pattern applies to all current and future components

**Next Session**:
- Verify Test 3 camera sync works across browsers
- Continue with Tests 4-10 from MULTI_BROWSER_TESTING_PROCEDURES.md
- Monitor for any other entities missing API integration pattern

## February 12, 2026 (Morning Session)

### VS Code Crash - Zombie Process Migration Failure ❌
- **Context**: VS Code crashed (SIGKILL exit code 137) during database migration attempt
  - Pattern: Recurring crash issue documented in CRASH_AUDIT_2026-01-30.md
  - Exit code 137 = SIGKILL = forced termination due to memory pressure
  - **Root cause**: 6+ zombie Prisma processes from previous sessions consuming resources

- **Investigation Process** (Protocol-Driven):
  1. Reviewed AI_AGENT_PROTOCOL.md crash prevention guidelines
  2. Reviewed CRASH_AUDIT_2026-01-30.md and DB_DEVELOPMENT_LESSONS.md
  3. Checked running processes: `ps aux | grep -E '(prisma|tsx|vite|node)'`
  4. Discovered critical evidence:
     - PID 26833: schema-engine running since **Monday 7PM** (40+ hours!) consuming **103.7% CPU**
     - PID 48424: Prisma Studio running from terminal (**protocol violation**)
     - PID 50257, 40782, 33997, 32601, 58205: Five **hung migration processes**
     - Total: 6+ zombie processes + active dev servers

- **Root Cause Analysis**:
  - **Primary**: No pre-migration cleanup - zombie processes accumulated over multiple sessions
  - **Secondary**: Prisma Studio running from terminal (explicitly forbidden by existing protocol)
  - **Tertiary**: Multiple concurrent migration attempts (each hung, never terminated)
  - **Result**: New migration spawned while 6 others hung → memory exhaustion → SIGKILL
  
- **Protocol Violation Assessment**:
  - Existing documentation **was available** in 3 files:
    - [CRASH_AUDIT_2026-01-30.md](../docs/CRASH_AUDIT_2026-01-30.md#L56): "Never run Prisma Studio from terminal"
    - [DB_DEVELOPMENT_LESSONS.md](../docs/DB_DEVELOPMENT_LESSONS.md#L142): "Check memory before operations"
    - [AI_AGENT_PROTOCOL.md](../_Utilities/AI_AGENT_PROTOCOL.md#L454): "Sequential operations only"
  - **Problem**: Documentation alone insufficient - protocols not being executed as checklists
  - **Solution**: Automated enforcement required

- **Solutions Implemented**:
  
  1. **Immediate Remediation**:
     - Killed all zombie processes: `pkill -9 -f 'prisma migrate|prisma studio|schema-engine'`
     - Verified cleanup: `ps aux | grep -E '(prisma|schema-engine)' | grep -v grep` → 0 processes
  
  2. **Created Pre-Migration Safety Script**:
     - File: [api/scripts/pre-migration-check.sh](api/scripts/pre-migration-check.sh)
     - Automated 6-step pre-flight checklist:
       1. ✅ Detect and terminate zombie Prisma processes
       2. ✅ Validate Prisma schema
       3. ✅ Test database connection
       4. ✅ Check available system memory (requires 500MB+)
       5. ✅ Warn about concurrent heavy processes
       6. ✅ Verify migrations directory exists
     - **Usage**: `./scripts/pre-migration-check.sh && npx prisma migrate dev --name migration_name`
     - Made executable: `chmod +x`
  
  3. **Enhanced AI_AGENT_PROTOCOL.md**:
     - Added comprehensive "Database Migration Safety Protocol" section
     - **Pre-Migration Mandatory Checklist** with explicit commands
     - **Migration Execution Rules** (❌ NEVER / ✅ ALWAYS lists)
     - **Common Migration Crash Scenarios** with prevention/recovery steps
     - **Post-Migration Verification** procedures
     - Integration point: After "Process Management" section (line ~480)
  
  4. **Updated DB_DEVELOPMENT_LESSONS.md**:
     - Added "CRITICAL: February 12, 2026 - Zombie Process Migration Crash" section
     - Documented all 7 zombie processes with PIDs and start times
     - Listed specific protocol violations with file references
     - Explained why protocols weren't followed (lack of automation)
     - Detailed new mandatory protocol for all migrations
     - Added testing verification commands
  
  5. **New Mandatory Workflow**:
     ```bash
     # BEFORE every migration
     ./scripts/pre-migration-check.sh
     
     # DURING migration
     # Monitor for completion, no other heavy operations
     
     # AFTER migration
     ps aux | grep -E '(prisma|schema-engine)' | grep -v grep
     # Must return 0 processes
     ```

- **Key Lessons**:
  - **Documentation ≠ Execution**: Even with detailed protocols, manual checklists get skipped
  - **Automation Required**: Crash-prone operations need automated pre-flight checks
  - **Zombie Detection**: Processes can hang for days silently consuming resources
  - **Exit Code 137**: Always means SIGKILL from memory pressure - check for resource hogs first
  - **Protocol Consolidation**: Migration rules now centralized in AI_AGENT_PROTOCOL with mandatory script

- **Files Modified**:
  - Created: [api/scripts/pre-migration-check.sh](api/scripts/pre-migration-check.sh) (new automated safety check)
  - Updated: [_Utilities/AI_AGENT_PROTOCOL.md](../_Utilities/AI_AGENT_PROTOCOL.md) (new Database Migration Safety Protocol section)
  - Updated: [docs/DB_DEVELOPMENT_LESSONS.md](../docs/DB_DEVELOPMENT_LESSONS.md) (February 12 incident documentation)
  - Updated: [DEVLOG.md](DEVLOG.md) (this entry)

- **Prevention Going Forward**:
  - ✅ Run `./scripts/pre-migration-check.sh` before EVERY migration (mandatory)
  - ✅ AI agents must execute automated checks, not just read protocols
  - ✅ Never run Prisma Studio from integrated terminal (use VS Code extension)
  - ✅ Always verify 0 zombie processes after any Prisma operation
  - ✅ Treat exit code 137 as "check for zombie processes" signal

- **System Status**:
  - ✅ All zombie processes terminated
  - ✅ Pre-migration safety script created and tested
  - ✅ Protocols updated with mandatory automation
  - ✅ Dev servers running cleanly (API: 3010, Frontend: 3011)
  - ⚠️  Database migration that triggered crash NOT completed - needs retry with safety script

- **Next Steps**:
  - If migration still needed: Run `./scripts/pre-migration-check.sh` first
  - Test automated safety script in next migration workflow
  - Consider adding pre-commit hook to catch hung processes
  - Monitor for protocol compliance in future sessions

### Railway Deployment Crash Fix - Seed Process Issue
- **Context**: VS Code hung and crashed during previous session; Railway API deployment returning 502 Bad Gateway
  - API server not responding: `{"status":"error","code":502,"message":"Application failed to respond"}`
  - Last commits were error handlers for unhandled rejections/exceptions
  - TypeScript compilation clean locally (0 errors)

- **Investigation Process** (Protocol-Driven):
  1. Linked Railway CLI to VideoDept-API service
  2. Verified environment variables: DATABASE_URL, ENABLE_MDNS=false, NODE_ENV=production ✅
  3. Confirmed Prisma migrations exist (6 migrations including signal flow models from Feb 9) ✅
  4. Reviewed nixpacks.toml start command ✅
  5. Identified local build passes cleanly ✅

- **Root Cause Discovered**:
  - Nixpacks start command: `npx prisma migrate deploy && npm run seed:all && npm run start`
  - `seed:all` script runs `seed:equipment` which first calls `equipment:export`
  - `equipment:export` attempts to read from database BEFORE seeding
  - Fails on fresh Railway deployments where no data exists yet
  - Process crashes, server never starts, returns 502

- **Solution Implemented**:
  - Changed nixpacks.toml start command to use `seed:all:prod` instead of `seed:all`
  - `seed:all:prod` skips export step and seeds directly from equipment-data.json
  - Proper sequence: migrate → seed from JSON → start server

- **Fix Applied**:
  ```toml
  [start]
  cmd = 'npx prisma migrate deploy && npm run seed:all:prod && npm run start'
  ```
  - Committed: `b110a35` - "fix: use seed:all:prod to avoid export step in Railway deployment"
  - Pushed to trigger automatic Railway redeployment

- **Key Lessons**:
  - Production seed scripts must not depend on existing database data
  - Railway deployments are ephemeral - always seed from static files
  - 502 errors indicate app crash during startup, not build failure
  - Protocol-driven investigation (link CLI → check vars → verify migrations → review config) efficiently identified issue

### Complete baseEntity Signal Flow Architecture - TypeScript Compilation Fixed
- **Context**: Railway deployment failing due to TypeScript build errors (exit code 2)
  - Initial symptom: 72 TypeScript compilation errors blocking production deployment
  - Root cause investigation revealed: Prisma client naming mismatch, not missing models
  - Discovery: All 9 signal flow models already existed in schema, only route files needed alignment

- **Investigation & Analysis**:
  - Identified 54 errors from unused route files (incorrect Prisma client references)
  - Identified 18 errors from active routes (field name mismatches, type casting issues)
  - Verified all 9 baseEntity models present in schema: cable_snakes, cam_switchers, vision_switchers, led_screens, media_servers, projection_screens, records, routers, streams
  - Verified all EventType enum values already exist (CAM_SWITCHER, VISION_SWITCHER, RECORD, STREAM)
  - Confirmed transform utilities (toCamelCase/toSnakeCase) properly established

- **Implemented Fixes** (following sources.ts pattern):
  1. **Prisma Client References** - Fixed all 9 route files
     - `prisma.cableSnake` → `prisma.cable_snakes`
     - `prisma.camSwitcher` → `prisma.cam_switchers`
     - `prisma.mediaServer` → `prisma.media_servers`
     - `prisma.visionSwitcher` → `prisma.vision_switchers`
     - `prisma.ledScreen` → `prisma.led_screens`
     - `prisma.projectionScreen` → `prisma.projection_screens`
     - `prisma.record` → `prisma.records`
     - `prisma.router` → `prisma.routers`
     - `prisma.stream` → `prisma.streams`
  
  2. **Database Field Names** - WHERE/ORDER BY clauses updated to snake_case
     - `productionId` → `production_id`
     - `isDeleted` → `is_deleted`
     - `createdAt` → `created_at`
     - Applied to all query constructions across 9 route files
  
  3. **Property Access Fixes** - Post-query entity object references
     - `entity.productionId` → `entity.production_id` in recordEvent() calls
     - Fixed in led-screens.ts, projection-screens.ts, records.ts
     - Ensures proper access to Prisma-returned snake_case fields
  
  4. **Active Route Corrections**:
     - [validation-helpers.ts:47](api/src/utils/validation-helpers.ts) - sources query uses `uuid` not `id` (sources table special case)
     - [settings.ts:510](api/src/routes/settings.ts) - added required `id`, `updated_at` fields to upsert, added crypto import
     - [equipment.ts](api/src/routes/equipment.ts) - fixed relation name `equipment_card_io` (was equipment_io_ports), added required fields
     - [admin.ts:184](api/src/routes/admin.ts) - FieldVersions type casting with `as unknown` intermediate, currentData declared as `any`
     - [productions.ts:232](api/src/routes/productions.ts) - FieldVersions type casting fix
  
  5. **Server Configuration**:
     - [server.ts:258-266](api/src/server.ts) - Uncommented all 9 route imports
     - [server.ts:281-289](api/src/server.ts) - Enabled all 9 route registrations
     - All signal flow endpoints now active: /api/cable-snakes, /api/cam-switchers, etc.
  
  6. **Build Configuration Cleanup**:
     - [package.json:8](api/package.json) - Restored clean build script: `"build": "tsc"`
     - [tsconfig.json](api/tsconfig.json) - Removed temporary `"noEmitOnError": false` workaround
     - TypeScript now properly enforces type safety during build

- **Validation Results**:
  - ✅ TypeScript compilation: **0 errors**, exit code 0
  - ✅ Build produces clean dist/ folder with all route files
  - ✅ All 9 signal flow routes enabled and registered
  - ✅ Transform pipeline intact: API (camelCase) ↔ Database (snake_case)
  - ✅ baseEntity pattern complete: id, production_id, created_at, updated_at, version, is_deleted, last_modified_by, synced_at

- **Architecture Pattern Confirmed**:
  ```typescript
  // Example: led-screens route
  const ledScreen = await prisma.led_screens.findUnique({
    where: { id, is_deleted: false }
  });
  await recordEvent({
    productionId: ledScreen.production_id, // ← snake_case from DB
    eventType: EventType.LED_SCREEN
  });
  io.emit('entity:created', {
    entity: toCamelCase(ledScreen) // ← Transform before sending to frontend
  });
  ```

- **Key Lessons**:
  - Prisma client property names mirror table names exactly (snake_case from schema)
  - Database returns snake_case fields, must be accessed with snake_case in TypeScript
  - Transform utilities convert at API boundary, not within route logic
  - Systematic sed/perl replacements effective for bulk fixes, multi_replace for precision
  - Protocol-driven investigation prevented premature implementation of unnecessary features

- **Ready for Deployment**:
  - All TypeScript errors resolved
  - Build configuration clean (no workarounds)
  - All 9 signal flow entity types operational
  - Ready to test on Railway production environment

### Bug Fixes - Infinite Render Loop Resolution
- **Fixed** Critical infinite render loop in Settings page (Maximum update depth exceeded)
  - **Root cause:** ServerConnection renderStatus callback creating dependency cycle
  - renderStatus was inline arrow function → new reference on every Settings render
  - ServerConnection useEffect had renderStatus in deps → triggered on every change
  - Created loop: render → new callback → useEffect → setState → render
  
- **Solution:** Applied Option C (architectural improvements)
  1. Memoized renderStatus callback with useCallback in Settings.tsx
  2. Removed renderStatus from ServerConnection useEffect dependency array
  - Follows React best practices
  - Prevents similar issues in the future
  
- **Commits:**
  - c6f5bcb: Fix infinite render loop in Settings page
  - 5d17dde: Remove troubleshooting debug logs from Settings.tsx

### Field-Level Versioning - Phase 3 Complete ✅
- **Fixed** Conflict resolution force save bug
  - Variable scoping issue: updatedProject out of scope in catch block
  - Fixed by reconstructing project object from activeProject
  - Added proper error handling with try/catch and user feedback
  - Added IndexedDB sync for force saves

- **Enhanced** Conflict resolution dialog
  - Upgraded from confirm() (2 options) to prompt() (3 options)
  - Option 1: Retry - reload fresh data and manually merge
  - Option 2: Keep Yours - force save, overwrite their changes
  - Option 3: Keep Theirs - discard your changes, load their version
  
- **Testing Results:** All Phase 3 tests passing
  - ✅ Test 1: Single browser field edits working
  - ✅ Test 2: Two browsers different fields - auto-merge successful
  - ✅ Test 3: Two browsers same field - conflict detected, retry option works
  
- **Settings Page:** Production info form with 7 editable fields (showName, client, venue, room, loadIn, loadOut, showInfoUrl)
- **Dashboard:** Added pencil edit button that navigates to Settings
- **Architecture:** Database-first with dual-path API (field-level + record-level fallback)
  - 16/16 backend tests passing
  - 14 tracked fields with JSONB field_versions column
  - Automatic conflict detection and resolution
  - Manual refresh required until Phase 4 WebSocket implementation
