- **Implemented** LogService for tracking application changes
  - Stores up to 1000 log entries in localStorage
  - Tracks settings additions, updates, deletions, and reordering
  - Tracks equipment additions, updates, deletions with change details
  - Includes timestamps, categories, and detailed change tracking
  
- **Created** Activity Logs page
  - Filter by category (all, settings, equipment, general)
  - Expandable entries showing field-level changes
  - Export logs as JSON
  - Clear logs functionality
  - Color-coded badges for categories and actions

### Centralized Settings Management

### Bug Fixes
- Fixed blank window issue (Cameras page was de-referenced)

### Infrastructure
- **Protocol**: Automatically commit and push after code changes (unless user says "don't push")
- **Protocol**: Server restart after large alterations
- All 4 settings lists (Source Types, Connector Types, Frame Rates, Resolutions) support drag-and-drop reordering
- Changes in Settings automatically propagate throughout application
- All changes tracked in Activity Logs
